# DatathonTarragona2018Group1
Code from Group 1: Data Quality. Tarragona Datathon, November 11 &amp; 12, 2018, Spain. Meassuring eICU data quality: an open and standarized approach.

Our challenge was to find an open, standard and general way to meassure the quality of data from all variables used in the eICU database. 
We choose the eICU as our main target database, but this approach can be extended to any other database. 

Althoug there are many scores that try to face the same issue, most of them are really specific for one kind of variables or tables, or are commercial products.

We have tested several R methods, and here we document our approach

This work and common efforts should be a starting point to create an International Critical Data Index, having all variables commonly used in critical patients, to manage interoperability between multiple databases in a more simple way, leading to  better and wider big data, machine learning and collaborative investigation framework
